Hi everyone, my name is Ami, a junior in the IT World. I'm interested in prompt engineering because I believe AI is a powerful tool for everyone, and yeah I am a Viber coder but with a humble personality and dedication to solving problems instead of asking, asking, and asking.

Most of my side project is developed by using an AI tool, with iterations over and over to improve it till complete as you can see in my repo. AI will not replace human my comrade, but it will be your saviour one day. Just don't believe any company that fired you for an AI reason, they don't actually know how to handle technology. 

I like cats too, may my life always be blessed with a munchkin breed kitten.

Thank you for reading, all the best everyone.
