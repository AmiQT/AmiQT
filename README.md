# Hi there, I'm Ami! 👋

### 👨‍💻 Junior IT Student | AI-Augmented Developer

I don't just write code; I engineer solutions. I believe AI is the ultimate productivity booster, and I use it to iterate faster, debug smarter, and build complete ecosystems—from Mobile to Cloud.

**My Philosophy:**
* 🤖 **AI is the engine, I am the steering wheel.** Leveraging Gen AI to accelerate Fullstack development (Flutter & Python).
* 🚀 **Problem Solver.** I prefer digging deep into documentation and refining logic rather than waiting for answers.
* 🐈 **Cat Enthusiast.** Manifesting a Munchkin kitten in my future.

**Current Focus:**
Building Scalable SaaS & Cloud Solutions (AWS, FastAPI, Supabase).

> "AI will not replace humans, but humans who use AI will replace those who don't."
